# Introduction and Objectives

>`Nginx` is often hailed as the Swiss Army knife of `web servers` for its **high performance**, **scalability**, and **versatility**. 

>Whether you're a web developer deploying static sites or a system administrator orchestrating complex, load-balanced environments, Nginx delivers unmatched speed and reliability.


## Key Use Cases
|**Use Case**| **Description**|
|--------|------------|
|**Static Hosting**| Fast delivery of `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS` and media files|
|**Reverse Proxy**| Distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers|
|**Load Balancing**| Automatically route requests to healthy servers|
|**API Gateway**| Secure and manage API traffic with rate limiting and authentication|


## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this repo, you’ll be able to:

1.  Understand `web server` fundamentals and discover what sets `Nginx` apart.
    
2.  Install `Nginx`, deploy your first site, and secure traffic with a firewall.
    
3.  Configure intermediate features—including `virtual servers`, `redirects`, `load balancing`, and `reverse proxying`—**using real-world examples**.
    
4.  Implement security best practices: set up `HTTPS`, manage `HTTP headers`, and add `authentication`.
    
5.  Optimize performance with rate limiting, content caching, compression, monitoring, and troubleshooting techniques.
